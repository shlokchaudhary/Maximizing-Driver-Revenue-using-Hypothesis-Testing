# Maximizing-Driver-Revenue-using-Hypothesis-Testing
This project applies statistical hypothesis testing to analyze whether payment method (Card vs Cash) has a significant impact on taxi trip fare amounts. Using real-world trip-level data, the analysis combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and a Welch’s two-sample t-test to derive actionable business insights.
